# tripleo-quickstart is checked out directly in gate jobs instead of installed
# through requirements file so we cannot handle changes on it. This however
# allows us to include the gate role in quickstart gate jobs and still use the
# "Depends-On" functionality to gate extra role changes.
# This can be also useful to skip roles that cannot be built by DLRN
